# Workflow Life Cycle

## Sequences
Typical development workflow will follow the following sequence:
  - Requirement gathering
  - Participation in system and interface design with Architects and UX Team
  - Lead SPRINT Planning (Define SPRINT goals)
  - Refining backlog with Product Owners and Team
  - Create tickets and associate estimations and  resources with team
  - Leading code reviews
  - Ensuring Testing Framework is in place to check deliverables and requirement are met.
  - Owning the code base and release cycles
  - Working with Platform team to mange deployment and release management
  - Managing bug fixes, and making sure regression tests are fully fulfilled
  - Supporting aftercare (Hypercare)
  - Refining and improving product and platform
  
  ## Managing Code Quality
  
  Ensuring quality of code is high, and meets stakeholder requirement while balancing constraints:
  
  - Having best practices in place and supporting continuos delivery. 
  - Using Automated Testing
  - Having  a code review process in place. 
  - Reducing manual testing times and spending more time on improving code quality
  - Follow and support development and usability standards proclaimed by W3C
  - Breaking features into smaller modules and having  test framework and documentation in place to support.
  - Ensuring incremental releases. As this will allow to mange volume of flaws
  - supports loose coupling and  ensures features are shipped with their context and configuration management services. 
  - No configurations will sit outside the features that are developed. They will be contained in the same repository. This will be to avoid platform configuration changes that can potentially result in code and applications breaking. Use Docker, Puppet and Vagrant to support the application build
  - Have documentation and dashboard available and easily accessible to the development team and stakeholders
  -  Ensure there is consistent and constant communication in the team with actions and setup agenda.
